# ClearTick – Project Overview

ClearTick is a translucent wristwatch built around:

- MCU: MSP430FR4133IG48
- RTC: RV-3028-C7
- Display: GDC0209 passive LCD
- Power: CR2032
- Programmer: MSP-FET430UIF

The goal is simple:
Expose the electronics instead of hiding them.

This is not a smartwatch.
No Bluetooth.
No notifications.
Just time — done cleanly.
